    <br>
    <p>We offers worldwide shipping where service is available through the shipping companies.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>USA & Canada Orders</h4>
    <p>Most deliveries within the US & Canada should arrive within 7 days after your shipping confirmation email is
        received.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Worldwide Orders</h4>
    <p>Deliveries outside of the US & Canada may take anywhere from 7-40 days to arrive, depending on the destination
        country.</p>
    <br>
    <p>These times may be delayed by a number of factors, including delays in customs processing within your destination
        country.</p>
    <br>
    <P>If your tracking number shows your package has been delivered, but you have not yet received it, please call your
        local post office for more information. If there is an issue with the listed address on your package, they may
        need to get in touch with you before delivery can be completed.</P>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Pre-orders & back-orders</h4>
    <p>We aims to provide accurate shipping & delivery estimates for pre-order and back-order products, but may be
        limited by production delays, shipping delays, and other factors outside of our control.</p>
    <br>
    <p>More information may be available on pre-orders and back-orders, on a case-by-case basis. Please contact support
        at the email listed in our site's footer for more details.</p>
